# Description 
 This fully back-end application is designed to make it easy to quickly alter information about your employees and the structure of your company. It stores new and updated data in SQL and can easily be altered depending on what the user of the application wants. Unfortunately my own personal password was used to make this work, so it has been removed and will need your personal password to be put in. This site uses inqurier, and mysql2. Thanks for the awesome tools!
